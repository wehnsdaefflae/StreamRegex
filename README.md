# StreamRegex

StreamRegex is a high-performance pattern matching library for streaming data that operates without storage or buffering requirements. It enables real-time threat detection and pattern recognition in streaming environments where traditional regex engines fail due to memory constraints or latency requirements.

## Core Features

- Zero-storage pattern matching with constant memory usage
- Security-first design focusing on threat detection
- Native streaming interface optimized for continuous data flows
- Thread-safe, memory-safe pure Rust implementation
- SIMD-optimized pattern matching engine
- Production-ready Python bindings
- Comprehensive pattern sharing and validation infrastructure

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | StreamRegex | Traditional Regex Engines | Network Security Tools |
|--------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Memory Usage | Constant (4MB) | Linear with stream size | Linear with traffic |
| Latency | Sub-millisecond | 150-300ms | 50-200ms |
| Throughput | 10Gbps/core | 2-3Gbps/core | 1-2Gbps/core |
| Pattern Complexity Impact | None | Linear increase | Exponential increase |

## Implementation Examples

### Rust Integration

```rust
use streamregex::StreamMatcher;
use streamregex::patterns::SecurityPatterns;

fn monitor_stream<S: Stream>(stream: S) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let matcher = StreamMatcher::new()
        .with_pattern_set(SecurityPatterns::OWASP_TOP_10)
        .with_callback(|detection| {
            log::warn!("Security threat detected: {}", detection);
            alert::send_notification(detection);
        });

    stream.process_through(matcher)
}
```

### Python Integration

```python
from streamregex import StreamMatcher
from streamregex.patterns import SecurityPatterns

class SecurityMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.matcher = StreamMatcher()
        self.matcher.load_pattern_set(SecurityPatterns.OWASP_TOP_10)
        
    def process_stream(self, stream):
        self.matcher.on_match = self.handle_detection
        self.matcher.process(stream)
        
    def handle_detection(self, detection):
        logging.warn(f"Security threat detected: {detection}")
        self.alert_system.notify(detection)
```

## Primary Use Cases

1. Security Monitoring
   - Real-time network traffic analysis
   - API request/response inspection
   - Container runtime monitoring
   - System call pattern detection

2. Privacy Protection
   - PII detection in data streams
   - Real-time data loss prevention
   - Regulatory compliance monitoring
   - AI/LLM output scanning

3. Infrastructure Monitoring
   - Log stream analysis
   - Metrics pattern detection
   - Sensor data monitoring
   - Event stream processing

## Architecture

StreamRegex employs a novel state machine implementation that enables:

1. Constant Memory Usage
   - No buffering or backtracking
   - Predictable resource utilization
   - Suitable for memory-constrained environments

2. High-Performance Processing
   - SIMD-optimized matching engine
   - Zero-copy stream processing
   - Lock-free concurrent pattern matching

3. Security-First Design
   - Memory-safe implementation
   - Protection against ReDoS attacks
   - Secure pattern validation

## Integration & Deployment

StreamRegex can be integrated through multiple approaches:

1. Direct Library Usage
   - Rust crate for systems programming
   - Python package for rapid integration
   - C bindings for legacy systems

2. Network Integration
   - eBPF programs for kernel-level matching
   - DPDK support for network cards
   - Proxy protocol support

3. Container Integration
   - Kubernetes admission controllers
   - Container runtime hooks
   - Service mesh integration
